# Posh + Starship Migration Guide

## What Changed

You've successfully migrated from **oh-my-zsh** to **Oh My Posh** while keeping your beloved **Starship** prompt! 🚀

### Before (oh-my-zsh)
- Used oh-my-zsh framework with `fino-time` theme
- Had multiple plugins managed by oh-my-zsh
- Linux/macOS only setup

### After (Posh + Starship)
- **Oh My Posh** for cross-platform prompt management 🌐
- **Starship** for your beautiful, consistent prompt across all platforms ⭐
- Manual plugin loading for better control and performance ⚡
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows! 🪟

## What You Get

### ✨ Cross-Platform Consistency
- Same beautiful starship prompt on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Unified configuration across all your machines
- Oh My Posh handles platform differences automatically

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

- Only load plugins you actually use
- Better resource usage

### 🛠️ Enhanced Features
- All your favorite aliases and functions preserved
- Better autocompletion with enhanced settings

- Smart directory navigation

### 🔧 Plugin Replacements
| Oh-My-Zsh Plugin | New Implementation |
|------------------|-------------------|

## Your Starship Config

Your beautiful starship configuration is preserved and enhanced:

- Clean box-drawing prompt design
- Language-specific icons (Node.js, Rust, Go, Python, etc.)
- Git status integration
- Command duration display

## Platform-Specific Notes

### 🐧 Linux/macOS
- Run the migration script: `~/.local/share/chezmoi/shellscripts/executable_posh_migration.sh`
- Apply changes: `chezmoi apply && source ~/.zshrc`

### 🪟 Windows
- Oh My Posh and Starship auto-install on first PowerShell run
- Same starship config shared across platforms
- PowerShell 7 recommended for best experience

## Optional Cleanup

Once you're happy with the new setup, you can remove oh-my-zsh:
```bash
# Backup first (just in case)
mv ~/.oh-my-zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh.backup

# Or remove entirely
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing autosuggestions?
Install manually:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

### Starship not showing?
Ensure starship is in your PATH:
```bash
# Check if installed
command -v starship

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows PowerShell issues?
Make sure you're using PowerShell 7:
```powershell
# Install PowerShell 7
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell

# Then use pwsh instead of powershell
```
